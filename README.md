This script is designed to prompt the user to input an email address and password, validate them against certain criteria, and then store them in a MySQL database. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

Importing Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries such as mysql.connector for MySQL database connection and re for regular expressions.

Establishing Database Connection: The script connects to the MySQL database using the provided credentials.

Email Validation: The script prompts the user to input an email address. It then validates the email address using a regular expression pattern (email_pattern) to ensure it follows the correct format. It also checks if the email domain is in the list of allowed email domains (email_domain_pattern). If the input email address passes the validation, the loop continues; otherwise, it prompts the user to enter the email address again.

Password Validation: Similar to email validation, the script prompts the user to input a password. It validates the password against certain criteria: at least 8 characters long, containing at least one letter, and containing at least one digit.

Database Query and Insertion: After both email and password pass validation, the script constructs an SQL query to insert the email address and password into the database table info. It executes the query using the execute() method and commits the changes to the database.

Retrieving and Printing Results: The script constructs a query to retrieve all records from the info table. It executes the query and fetches the results. Then, it iterates over the results and prints each email address and its corresponding password.

Closing Database Connection: Finally, the script closes the cursor and database connection.

Overall, this script provides a basic user authentication system by validating email addresses and passwords and storing them in a MySQL database. It also retrieves and displays the stored email addresses and passwords.
